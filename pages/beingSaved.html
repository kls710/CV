  <h3>How to save your Spirit from Hell and much more.</h3>

  <br>
  <p>Imagine someone gets into a car accident. They are badly hurt. Who do <br>
    you call? Hopefully an ambulance! Or what if someone is drowning out in <br>
    the ocean off the beach shore? Who do you call? A lifeguard. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Just like those in need of saving, Jesus was sent to save us. <br>
    He is a divine being though. He did not <strong>have</strong> to come, <br>
    but He chose to on our behalf. What better love than to have a divine God <br>
    leave his domaine to come and help guide his children -his creation, away <br>
    from sin and back into being good again, knowing that He was going to suffer <br>
    at the hands of men to do it.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Lets understand something. At any time Jesus could have called legions of <br>
    his angels to his side at any given moment. But He knew that the only way <br>
    to get those He taught to see the love He had for us all, was to show us He would <br>
    suffer through our sins and die in agony to do so. </p>

  <hr>
  <p>Just like the angels that sinned against God in the high heaven, and got <br>
    thrown out. We as his other creation are in danger of eternal separation from him. <br>
    The big difference here is that the angels were already angelic and have had <br>
    their eternal souls -bodies. </p>
  <p>As we were taught how to sin against God not by our own free will but by <br>
    angelic beings, God seen good in some of us and wants to save as many as he can. <br>
    Knowing how powerful sin is, <strong>Jesus was sent to show us a new way to be saved.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>In the beginning stages of our creations. Long after Adam and Eve. God sent <br>
    commandments to a man named Moses. Now moses was to teach everyone the laws <br>
    of which God gave to the Israelites. Telling them to obey them. </p>
  <br>
  <p>But that is the law we were to follow until the coming of Christ.<br>
    Believers are now in what we call 'the church age'. The time after Jesus' <br>
    teachings. So we shall listen to the new plan for salvation. </p>

  <hr>
  <p>You see, the original purpose of the commandments were to bring law <br>
    and order to the people. To bring everyone closer to God. But as the <br>
    pharisees -teachers; got a hold of them, the turned God's plan into <br>
    a law and order of obedience. They were hypocrites.</p>
  <p> It is much easier for a human to teach someone to just do something, <br>
    rather to do it themselves and let that guide people alone.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This is why Jesus came to show a new way. To prove that even those <br>
    who 'thought' they were perfect in obeying God, were not doing so. <br>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h5>Jesus' Teaches how to be saved in person this time.</h5>
  <br>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Matthew 5:18 <br>
      For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, <br>
      one jot or tittle will by no means pass from the law till <br>
      all is fulfilled.


    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <p>Jesus is telling them here, The law that was given to you will absolutely <br>
    still apply until my entire message is heard and understood, and till after I <br>
    am cursed to die by the hands of man for telling you these truths. You <br>
    all must obey the commandments.</p>
  <p>Moreless, Jesus came to fulfill the Law given to them by living a completely <br>
    sinless life. Not one single time did Jesus ever sin.</p>

  <hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Colossians 2:14,15 <br>
      And you being dead in you trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, <br>
      He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven all you trespasses, <br>
      having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, <br>
      which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, <br>
      having nailed it to the cross.


    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <br>
  <p>Now Jesus does have a couple laws in the New Testament. See below verses.</p>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Matthew 22:37,38
      Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God will all your heart,
      with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the first and
      greatest commandment. And the second is like it:
      'You shall love your neighbor as yourself'.
      <br>
      Galatians 6:2
      Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <p>So we conclude that the believer is not expected to keep the Old Testament Law. <br>
    However, there are some commandments that Jesus has given us that should <br>
    be obeyed.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h5>Some extra food for thought if you choose <br>
    not to follow Christ' message of salvation.</h5>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Acts 16:31
      And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.


    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <p>*The house God prepared for you.</p>
  <br>
  <hr>

  <p>God created and sustains everything in the universe, <br>
    Genesis 1:1O; Job 38:1-41 … including you. It is He who established the <br>
    unchanging laws of nature and morality. It is He who has ultimate authority <br>
    over His creation. It is He who desires for you to be in a right <br>
    relationship with Him ,1 Timothy 2:3-4.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In addition to being the Creator, God has another title — Judge. <br>
    He has established good and righteous laws for our benefit, <br>
    but sadly you (and I and everyone else) have disobeyed His laws in <br>
    one way or another: by lying, lusting, gossiping, slandering, envying, <br>
    coveting, stealing, cheating, using God’s or Jesus’ name as a curse word, <br>
    or loving someone or something more than God. Some of God’s laws that <br>
    we’ve broken are listed in Exodus 20:1-17O 'The 10 Commandments' or <br>
    in Matthew 5 also. If your violations of God’s laws are not resolved <br>
    on His terms, you will stand before Him as Judge someday. And that <br>
    would be a very scary position the be in.</p>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <p>This is ewhat we all need to be saved from. God's wrath from judgment. <br>
    Or as the Bible will tell you in <em>Revelation 20:15</em> being saved from <br>
    being thrown into the 'lake of fire'. If you deny God and offer of reconciliation, <br>
    you will find not just a God of peace, forgiving, and murciful. You will <br>
    find a <strong>justified</strong> God.</p>
