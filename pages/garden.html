  <h3>What was it like and what happened to it?</h3>
  <p>First lets interpret the words "Garden and Eden". <br>
    The ancient Greek translation is the words <em>gan</em> and <em>`Eden</em>.<br>
    <strong>gan</strong> meaning: enclosed garden, and <strong>`Eden</strong> meaning: pleasure. <br>
    So the Garden of Eden was an enclosed garden that fulfilled pleasure by its beauty.<br>
    This is referring to The Earth as a garden that was also beautiful and caused pleasure <br>
    for your soul. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>God created an absolute paradise. The greenest most lush herbs, plants, and trees <br>
    you could ever dream up. Water so pure, you could reach out and drink from <br>
    any stream. The most pure air you could ever imagine. <br>
    Imagine earth from the beginning. No humans, no cut down trees, absolute zero pollution. <br>
    The most pure bliss you could ever imagine.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>God wanted to create us in his image, and wanted man to use his free will <br>
    to choose Him. When God made Adam and Eve, He placed them in the Garden. <br>
    There were two kinds of trees. One of good and evil, the other, the tree <br>
    of life. The tree of good and evil represented satan, the tree of life <br>
    represented God. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>To better illustrate this. Look at a mother with her son. Her son picks up <br>
    a bottle of cleaner. The mother tells him to put it down, do not drink from this. <br>
    She issues a loving warning, do not drink from this because you will be poisoned. <br>
    If the child disobeys and drinks from the bottole, he will be poisoned, <br>
    which is a huge problem.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This is how God operates. He told Adam and Eve, of all the trees in the garden <br>
    <strong>do not</strong> eat of this tree. Then gives them the free will <br>
    because he never wants to force anyones love from them but he is our Father <br>
    and will punish us just like our human parents would for disobedience.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>God was honest about the tree of good and evil. He warned them that eating <br>
    from it would result in death. But he left the choice up to them.<br>
    Then satan twisted God's words to Eve and lied to her. Making her believe that <br>
    God was withholding something incredible from them. Satan made her doubt <br>
    God's good heart for them.</p>

  <p>Once satan was able to convince them to eat from the tree, the poison of <br>
    sin entered their lives. Meaning: Now they know what its like to do what <br>
    they were told not to. The consequences of what they did were so profound, <br>
    affecting all of humanity even until today. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>That is why God made plans, took steps to try and save us from the effects of <br>
    what happened in the Garden of Eden. He wants us to come back to him. To the light.
