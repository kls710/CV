  <h3>How outside forces influence our behavior.</h3>
  <p>With angelic beings messing with mankind. Laughing, poking, influencing us, <br>
    How will I know I am saved?</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This topic will be rather short as I have a link at the bottom of the <br>
    homepage on <a href="#" class="notSavedLink">How to be Saved.</a></p>
  <hr>
  <p>You see Jesus gave us all commandments. He told us all that we should <br>
    love one another, treaat our parents with respect, never hold grudges, <br>
    so on and so forth. But he Never <strong>actually</strong> said that <br>
    this is how your saved from Hell.</p>
  <p>When God sent his spirit into Mary to be born on this earth. To feel what <br>
    we feel. To die like a normal man, feeling the agnony of a human suffering. <br>
    He came onto the scene as he said he would in earlier scripture <br>
    to give us a <strong>new</strong> way of salvation.</p>
  <hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Romans 10:9-10 <br>
      That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, <br>
      and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, <br>
      thou shalt be saved. <br>
      For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; <br>
      and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <hr>
  <p>Jesus is telling us that in order to be saved. You <strong>must</strong> <br>
    believe that he was sent here to give us the new way of salvation, even <br>
    if it meant that he would suffer in agonizing pain to do so.<br>
    God does not want to force people into his arms. If he was to appear <br>
    before us in full glory, we would have no free will to choose.The time will <br>
    come when God will rule over us but the time is not right in his eyes. <br>
    We should never as a human species judge God's judgment. He is <strong>perfect.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>So when you hear of people saying, "It's not Christian like of you to do <br>
    something". They are speaking merely on man's opinion, <strong>not</strong> God's.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This is why many so called Christians and other types of Jesus believers <br>
    are lost. Because they are either misinformed, or studying bad doctrine. <br>
    They believe that by their <strong>works</strong>, they will be saved. <br>
    When this is just not true. No where in the church age bible does it say that <br>
    you will be saved by your works. But you <strong>should</strong> live <br>
    a rightous life. <br> </p>
