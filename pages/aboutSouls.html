    <h3>Your Spirit described.</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p>I will mention -for education sake; that the word Spirit has been <br>
    translated from both ancient Hebrew and Greek. So as in the Bible, <br>
  when you see the word, breath and life in the Bible. It is referring <br>
to a 'soul' not your 'spirit'. </p>
<hr>
<p>The differences between Spirit and Soul are pronounced in the Bible. <br>
A soul is referenced as a living thing. Like me saying, "oh, that poor soul" <br>
moreless "oh that poor person". </p>
<p>A Spirit on the other hand is the flow of energy inside of you. It is what makes <br>
you, you. What gives you 'life'.</p>
<hr>

<h5>Let me put it this way.</h5>
<br>
<p>Think of your Soul as a battery powered radio. And your Spirit is the battery. <br>
 The battery powers the radio bringing it to life. Giving it a 'life-force'. <br>
Without your spirit -the battery, your Soul -Your flesh and bones, will die. <br>
But like any radio, it can only run so long before mechanical failures happen. <br>
Your battery -Spirit, still has plenty of juice, but your Soul -the body <br>
withers away.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is why God says that when he returns back to earth. He will not only <br>
call those of us that are still alive to meet him in the air, but during <br>
the trumpet blasts of his coming, he will raise the dust from our dead bodies <br>
back up and place our spirits into transformed souls -bodies. </p>
<p>They will be angelic and last for all of eternity. So long as your spirit <br>
is saved that is...</p>
