  <h3>The answer is, mainly yes...</h3>
  <p>The below verses of the Bible show that almost all sin is equal to God.</p>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      James 2:10 - For whosoever shall keep the whole law, <br>
      and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all. <br>
      <br>
      Matthew 7:1-5 - Judge not, that ye be not judged. <br>
      <br>
      Romans 3:23 - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; <br>
      <br>
      James 2:10-11 - For whosoever shall keep the whole law, <br>
      and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all. <br>
      <br>
      Romans 3:10 - As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: <br>
      <br>
      1 John 3:15 - Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: <br>
      and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. <br>
      <br>
      1 John 5:16-17 - If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, <br>
      he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. <br>
      There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. <br>
      <br>
      Matthew 12:31 - Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy <br>
      shall be forgiven unto men: <br>
      but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. <br>
      <br>
      Galatians 6:7 - Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, <br>
      that shall he also reap. <br>
      <br>
      Galatians 3:10 - For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: <br>
      for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth <br>
      not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. <br>
      <br>
      Mark 7:21-23 - For from within, out of the heart of men, <br>
      proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

  <hr>
<p>The concept of an unforgivable sin is hard to reconcile with the idea of God <br>
   as an energy of infinite love. It does make sense, however, once we realize <br>
    that it is not God that forgives. It is we who must forgive ourselves in <br>
     order to move forward into the new age to come. We must free ourselves <br>
      from the negative consequences of old beliefs, turning instead to the <br>
       new beliefs, the new awareness, that comes as we accept ourselves as  <br>
       the spiritual beings we truly are.  <br>
<br>
We can't accomplish that forgiveness if we don't believe the Spirit is present <br>
 and available. It's not possible to claim a spiritual Truth if we don't  <br>
 believe its spiritual Source. If we deny our Oneness with the divine,  <br>
 we are closing ourselves off from the very energy that seeks to embrace  <br>
 us with infinite love. It's not that God won't forgive us; it's that by <br>
  choosing to believe in separation and judgment, we are refusing  <br>
  to forgive ourselves.</p>
<p>This is why blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is unforgivable.</p>
<br>
<hr>
  <h5>Examples of forgivable blasphemy.</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
  Lying - like Abraham lied about Sarah.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adultery - like when David slept with his very good friends wife.
  </li>
  <li>
    Crime - that Rome deemed worthy of death - The man on the cross next to Jesus.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cursing - Peter
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>


<p>Now there were <strong>two</strong> men on a cross on either side of Jesus. <br>
And the two are very different from one another. Both commited a crime <br>
punishable of death. But one looked over at Jesus and said, <br>
<em>"If thou beChrist, save thyself and us."</em> <br>
This is blasphemy in the eyes of God. You should never tempt the Lord our God. <br>
Jesus could have legions of angels come to his rescue, he had to finish what <br>
he started.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>But the other man rebuked the man saying, <em>"Dost not thou fear God, seeing <br>
  thou art in the same condemnation"</em> (sentencing) <em>And we indeed <br>
  justly; for we recieve the due reward of our deed: <br>
  but this man hath done nothing amiss.</em> <br>
  and then he said to Jesus, <em>"Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy <br>
    kingdom."</em>
</p>
<p>Then that is when Jesus turned to him saying, <em>Verily I say unto thee,<br>
To day shault thou be with me in paradise.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p>These are from verses 23:39-43 of Luke.</p>
<br>
<p>You see, One man did not believe in Jesus, but the other showed that he put <br>
his trust into him.</p>
<p>The difference?</p>
<p>One man is destined for Hell for not believing, for blaspheming His spirit.<br>
The other, he was joined by Jesus in his fathers home in paradise.</p>
<p><strong>Do not</strong> doubt that Jesus was who he said he was, God. He was <br>
sent to try and give people a new way to enter the kingdom. If you pass away <br>
from old age or by other means, I pray that you put your faith and trust into <br>
Jesus and believe that he came with the message of salvation, and died for you <br>
on the cross.</p>
