  <h3>The angels that sinned against God.</h3>
  <p>So lets dive into some of the things that happened near the beginning of <br>
    mankind. We'll explore how not even angelic beings were sinless and disobeyed God</p>
  <hr>

  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Ephesians 6:12 <br>
      For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,<br>
      against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,<br>
      against spiritual wickedness in <strong>high places.</strong><br>
    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <p>So according the Ephesians. We do not fight against ourselves. <br>
    We fight against outside forced influncing us. Little nudges here and there <br>
    getting us to sin against God.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>We see in the passage that I bolded, the word "high places". <br>
    If we look up the root meaning to the words, we find in ancient greek the <br>
    work <em>epouranios</em>: meaning, "above the sky: <strong>celestial</strong>,<br>
    heavenly, high." </p>
  <hr>
  <p> So what is this telling us? That we are fighting against things in the visable <br>
    universe. That there are beings out there that are influncing humanity in ways <br>
    that they should not be.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Now, in the dead sea scrolls were found <em>The Book of Enoch.</em><br>
    Scholars do not necessarily adopt it as Bible scripture but they do recognize <br>
    it as an Anicent Hebrew Document based on the time period of the Bible.<br>
    Like a lot of Books that were not included into the Bible or else the Bible <br>
    would be MASSIVE. This book was proof that it was known by Jews and early Christians.
    This was a book written right before the flood.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Enoch explains that the sons of God came unto the daughters of man and <br>
    defiled themselves (sinning) against God by having babies to our Earthly <br>
    women. The babies were called <em>Nephilim</em>(also recorded in Gen 6:1-4).<br>
    They were very tall, extremely strong. These babies grew up to be the heros of <br>
    ancient civilization because of their great strength and power.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Gen 6:1-6 <br>
      And it came to pass, <br>
      when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, <br>
      and daughters were born unto them, <br>
      That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; <br>
      and they took them wives of all which they chose. <br>
      And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, <br>
      for that he also is flesh: <br>
      yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. <br>
      There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, <br>
      when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, <br>
      and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men <br>
      which were of old, men of renown. <br>
      And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, <br>
      and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <br>
      was only evil continually. <br>
      And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, <br>
      and it grieved him at his heart.
    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <hr>
  <p>When God seen what his sons have done on earth, he rejected them. They were <br>
    immediately chained for sinning against God and placed in <em>tartarus</em>. <br>
    These were the "watchers", angels that God appointed to overlook the growth <br>
    of mankind.</p>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      2 Peter 2:4 <br>
      For if God spared not the angels that sinned,<br>
      but cast them down to <strong>hell</strong>,<br>
      and delivered them into chains of darkness,<br>
      to be reserved unto judgment;
    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <hr>
  <p>If we look at the word hell by its root meaning. We will see there are <br>
    a few words that "hell" is translated from in ancient Greek.<br>
    From <em>Tartaros</em> (the deepest abyss of Hell). <br>
    So these "watchers" were sent to the deepest abyss of hell.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>So you may be wondering, "Well are they not chained in Hell and <br>
    not able to cause bad influnces in the minds of humans anymore?"<br>
    Not quite. <br>
    If we look at the Book of Job: pronounced Jobe. We will see that even <br>
    Satan was able to approach God asking for permission to get Job to sin <br>
    against God. <br>
    Now Job was a man on Earth that God seen had a good heart, he feared the Lord <br>
    and always obeyed him. <br>
    But Satan approached God saying, Job is nothing. Take away all that he has <br>
    and I guarantee he will curse your name like everyone else.</p>
  <hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Job 1:6-11 <br>
      Now there was a day when the <strong>sons of God came to present themselves
      </strong> before <br>
      the LORD, <strong>and Satan came also among them.</strong> <br>
      And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? <br>
      Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, <br>
      and from walking up and down in it. <br>
      And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, <br>
      that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, <br>
      one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? <br>
      Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? <br>
      Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, <br>
      and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the <br>
      work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. <br>
      But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, <br>
      and he will curse thee to thy face.

    </blockquote>
  </em>

  <p>So we see in these passages that Satan and his crew of angels <br>
    are not locked up yet because they were even able to approach God; <br>
    asking for permission to do harm to Job. <br>
    This means that satan and his group of angles are where? <br>
    <em>high places</em> or <em>in the universe. Ephesians 6:12 states this <br>
      at the beginning of the page.</em> </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Reguarding future events. Revelation is where we must go.</p>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Rev 12:7-9 <br>
      And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against <br>
      the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, <br>
      And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. <br>
      And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, <br>
      and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into <br>
      the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.



    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <hr>
  <p>So when satan influenced the rebellion against God by getting <em>watchers</em><br>
    to sleep with the women of earth, he was casted out into the universe. <br>
    Away from Gods throne. Because we know that Gods throne is not of this universe, <br>
    but <strong>outside</strong> of the universe in a place of eternity. <br>
    The future Revelation says that God will appear and physically go to war with <br>
    satan and the angels he casted out. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Then onces he is defeted, he and his followers <br>
    will be thrown down to earth. This is when the anti-christ will rise and Satan <br>
    will influence people on earth by making amazing wonders and bringing in an era of <br>
    peace. But it will be a false peace. A deciving peace for his true intentions. <br>
    He wants to get everyone on earth on his side. So that he can prepare another <br>
    war against God. Like a final stance. Only thing is, is satan will cause <br>
    millions of people on earth to go to hell also. Because of their rebellion against <br>
    God. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>Whatever you do, if we are alive when these start to unfold, do not stand <br>
    for it. Your eternal soul (your living conscience that make you, you) will be <br>
    cast away along with the angels into Hell.<br>
    Your flesh is just a container for your soul. But when God saves you, your <br>
    flesh will be mad angelic like angels that will never grow old and die. It <br>
    will be a body that will allow your soul to accompany it for forever.</p>
