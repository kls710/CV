  <p>This requires a much longer read to understand what is to take place <br>
    before his second coming.</p>
  <p>But..</p>
  <p>Please follow along with this so that you won't be caught off guard.</p>
  <hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Matthew 24:3-5 <br>
      And he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, <br>
      saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign <br>
      of thy coming, and of the end of the world? <br> <br>
      And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
      <br><br>
      For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall <br>
      deceive many.


    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <hr>
  <p>So Jesus is telling us, <strong>do not</strong> let no one make you believe <br>
    in anything that he has not told you. Make sure your not deceived into believing <br>
    that God ( Jesus ) has returned because you'll surely know when he does as we continue. </p>
<hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
Matthew 24:6-8 <br>
And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: <br>
for all these things <strong>must</strong> come to pass, but the end is not yet. <br>
<br><br>
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there <br>
shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. <br>
All these things are the beginning of sorrows.

    </blockquote>
  </em>
<hr>
<p>So Jesus tells us that there will be wars and rumors of wars that will <br>
come to pass. There will be massive food shortages (famines), there will <br>
be <strong>many epidemic diseases</strong> (pestilences), and there will <br>
be earthquakes around the world (divers places). This will be a sign of the <br>
beginning of sorrows (Translated from Greek as <em>oden</em> meaning <br>
"childbirth" because its an agonizing state to be in ).  </p>
<hr>
<em>
  <blockquote>
    Matthew 24:9-12 <br>
    Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill <br>
    you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. <br>
    <br>
    And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one <br>
    another, and shall hate one another. <br>
    <br>
     And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. <br>
     <br>
     And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold <br>


  </blockquote>
</em>
<hr>
<p>Here it is saying that as a believer in Jesus, you will be <br>
burdened, persecuted, troubled by non-believers because you follow Jesus. <br>
So then people will hate each other and be offended by one another because <br>
you are a believer in Jesus Christ. <br> <br>
Many false people will come and go uttering divine prophecies and many will <br>
choose to believe them as if they have divine knowledge. (prophets <br>
translated from ancient Greek as <em>pseudoprophetes</em> meaning, people <br>
who believe they have God's ability to foresee upcoming events.)<br>
<br>
Then lastly he is stating that iniquity (violation/wickedness)
shall abound (increase or multiply), the love of many will grow cold. <br>
 </p>
 <hr>
 <br>
 <p>In Matthew 24:27 Jesus explains to his chosen group of people to <br>
 preserve his message, That as lightning comes out of the east, and shines <br>
to the west, so it will be when <em>He</em> returns to earth.</p>
<hr>
<p>
  In Matthew 24:29-31 Jesus is explaing; After those days, the sun will grow dark <br>
and the moon will no longer shine. The stars will fall from heaven, and the <br>
powers in heaven will be shaken. (possibly meteors falling onto earth, and large <br>
blasts in space?) <br>
Then there will be a sign in <strong>heaven</strong> (translated from <em>ouranos</em>
meaning <br>
the world, the universe), and the tribes of the earth will mourn, and we will see
Jesus coming from the clouds with amazing power and glory.<br>
  </p>
<hr>
<p>Jesus in a very serious manner wanted to get a strong point across to his <br>
chosen few. To make sure these words of his were understood. He told them this <br>
parable(a story to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson). <br>
</p>

<em>
  <blockquote>
    Matthew 24:43-44 <br>
    But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch <br>
    the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered <br>
    his house to be broken up.<br>
    Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not <br>
    the Son of man cometh.

  </blockquote>
</em>

<hr>
<p>Jesus is clearly telling us, look. I have been teaching you and giving you <br>
so many hints. If you do not listen to me, I will show up back to earth <br>
and you will be shocked and not ready for me just as you were not ready for <br>
a theif.<br>
Jesus gave us a book of instructions and it is up to all of us to believe his <br>
words or when he shows up, it will be too late to change your mind. You'll <br>
be left behind to suffer the earths ending.</p>
<hr>
<p>All that has been said, there is much more so it is up to you to pick up <br>
a Bible and read it. I recommend starting at the New testiment since we are <br>
very close to the end times.</p>
<p>With some of the seeriousness and signs pointed out, what are the top signs <br>
   to look out for before Jesus returns?</p>
