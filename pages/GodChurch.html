    <p>Very simple. God's church is not in a church building. <br>
      It is not in any structure built on this entire planet.
      Gods church is...<br>
      Within <strong>you</strong>.<br>
      Each and everyone of us are churches according to Jesus. </p>
  </div>

  <em>

    <blockquote>

      Mat 16:18 <br>
      And I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock <br>
      I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
    </blockquote>

  </em>

<hr>
  <p>Jesus actually gave Peter this nickname. Meaning "rock". <br>
  And <em>Upon this rock, I <strong>will</strong> build my church. </em> </p>
<hr>
  <p>The reference of the <em>chruch</em> is all over the book of Acts. </p>
<hr>
<em>
  <blockquote>
    Act 14:27 <br>
    And when they come, and had gathered the <strong>church</strong> <br>
    together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them <br>
    and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
  </blockquote>
</em>

<hr>

<p>This is saying when the apostles of Jesus gathered <em>his followers</em><br>
They told them all they learned about being saved. So that the Gentiles (non jewish people)<br>
would also know how to be saved during the 2nd coming of Christ. </p>
<hr>

<p>You see, God's church does not reside in a building or structure. God's messages <br>
are his church. </p>
<p>If you do not attend church, it does not mean your not saved or your not a Christian. <br>
You are a living breathing church so long as you spread the word of God. </p>
