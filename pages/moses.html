  <h3>Jesus was to parallel Moses to prove he is God. <br>
    That he was telling the truth.<br>
    That Jesus <u><strong>is</strong></u> God in the flesh (mortal like us).</h3>
  <p>- Moses a jew was born when Egyptions (gentiles) ruled over the people of Israel</p>
  <p>- Jesus a jew was born when Romans (gentiles) ruled over the people of Israel.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>- The Pharaoh during Moses' time decreed that all male Hebrew babies should be killed. <br>
    and they were. </p>
  <p>- King Herod during Jesus' time decreed that all male Hebrew babies should be killed. <br>
    and the were.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>- Moses' name means to draw out of water. The Pharaoh's daughter named him<br>
    that after she rescued him out of the nile river giving him <strong>salvation</strong>; meaning<br>
    (preservation or deliverance from harm, ruin, or loss.). </p>
  <p>- Well Jesus' name in ancient hebrew is 'Yeshua' which means <strong>salvation.</strong> </p>
  <hr>
  <p>- God favored Moses as an infant. Pharaoh's daughter took him from the water <br>
    and he became prince the of Egypt.</p>
  <p>- Well with Jesus, when he was born, Wise men worshipped Him and presented <br>
    very wealthy riches to him, (Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh. Very expensive ). </p>
  <hr>
  <p>- Moses was brought up by Pharaoh who was not his real father.</p>
  <p>- Jesus was brought up by Joseph who was not his real father.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>- Moses saw the burdens of his Israelite people and felt great compassion <br>
    on them.</p>
  <p>- Jesus saw His people as sheep (jews and gentiles) without a shepherd <br>
    (no guidance) and had great compassion on them. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>- Moses went to a well, was kind to the daughters of the priest of Midian, <br>
    and watered their livestock (not the usual custom).</p>
  <p>- Jesus went to a well, was kind to a Samaritan woman and offered her <br>
    water (not the usual custom).</p>
  <hr>
  <p>- Moses was in exile in a foreign land until the king of Egypt died.</p>
  <p>- Jesus was in exile in a foreign land until King Herod died </p>
  <hr>
  <p>You see. The list can go on and on. Everything Moses did, Jesus had to do. <br>
    Moses was used to represent God before his coming to earth. <br>
    Just like how Moses collected his people and brought them out of uncertainty, <br>
    Jesus collected his people and brought them out of uncertainty.<br>
    Moses went up the mountain of Mount Sinai to speak with God and recieve his orders <br>
    for earth. He left his people at the bottom for 40 whole days and nights. <br>
    Many of the people starting turning away from Moses. Thinking he abandoned <br>
    them. So when he came back down off the deserted mountain top, many followers <br>
    fell away.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Then 1443 years later, Jesus was born and spread his message of salvation <br>
    to his people. He said he would be leaving them (dying) but will be <em>coming back soon.</em> <br>
    And look what is happening today. People are asking, Where is He? He said He <br>
    would be back soon? Now many are falling away just as what happened with Moses.
  </p>

  <hr>
  <em>
    <blockquote>
      2 Peter 3:8-10 <br>
      But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, <br>
      that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, <br>
      and a thousand years as one day. <br>
      The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, <br>
      as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, <br>
      not willing that any should perish, <br>
      but that all should come to repentance. <br>
      But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; <br>
      in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, <br>
      and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, <br>
      the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. <br>
    </blockquote>
  </em>
  <p>Whatever you do.. <strong>Do not</strong> stay unkowledable of the Lord. <br>
  Because like his story says, <strong>No one</strong> knows the day or the hour, <br>
If you are not ready, he will show up to earth like a theif in the night <br>
unannounced. And it will be too late for so many people. It will be a terrifying <br>
day for millions who are not prepared. And even more frightning for what will <br>
happen to their soul for <strong>ALL</strong> of eternity.  </p>

<hr>
<p>Jesus is giving us plenty of time to belive he is who he says he is. <br>
To believe that he is the first and the last. The alpha and omega. <br>
The beginning and the end.<br>
If you are ignorant of these 'very simple instructions', you will surely be <br>
begging for mercy from God which will not be shown.</p>
