  <h3>Does the Bible mention Dinosaurs? <br>
    in any of the Books?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>In the King James Bible... No. It does not mention the word <em>dinosaurs</em>. <br>
    But for a reason...</p>
  <p>The word "dinosaur" was not even part of <strong>any</strong> language <br>
    nor thought of until 1842. Long after the King James Bible was translated <br>
    from Greek and Hebrew. So it makes perfect sense as to why it is not referenced, <br>
    because <strong>the word was not invented yet.</strong>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p>The word 'Dinosaur'(translated from: Dinosauria) was invented by a man named <em>Sir Richard Owen.</em> <br>
    He was scientist born in 1804, Lancaster, UK. A scientist of biology, anatomist, and paleontology. <br>
    Richard is widely known for founding the Natural History Museum in the UK. Also very <br>
    widely known for disagreeing with the commonly know 'Darwin' of evolution. Darwin <br>
    had Owens helping him on occasions with his work. </p>
  <hr>
  <p>So with all that out of the way. Does the Bible 'reference' anything like a dinosaur? <br>
    Yes in fact it does.<br>
    Back then they refered to them as <em>Dragons.</em> not our modern word 'dinosaur'. <br>
    here are a few passages in Scripture that may give a specific reference <br>
    to dinosaurs. These passages are found in the Book of Job and they refer to <br>
    creatures known as the behemoth and the leviathan.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Behemoth translated from the word <em>behemowth</em> an ancient egyption word,<br>
    a diplodocus or brachiosaurus. The exact meaning (which type) is unknown.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>leviathan translated from the word <em>livyathan</em> meaning a sea monster, <br>
    dragon, extremely large aquatic animal, like the plesiosaurus (which type) is unknown.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Read how these creatures are described in the Bible.</p>

  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Job 40:15-24 <br>
      Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. <br>
      Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the <br>
       navel of his belly. <br>
      He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are <br>
       wrapped together. <br>
      His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like  <br>
      bars of iron. <br>
      He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make  <br>
      his sword to approach unto him. <br>
      Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts <br>
       of the field play. <br>
      He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. <br>
      The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of  <br>
      the brook compass him about. <br>
      Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth  <br>
      that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. <br>
      He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

  <h5>Behemoth described.</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      God made them along side us.
    </li>
    <li>
      They eat grass <strong>like</strong> an ox, but is not an ox.
    </li>
    <li>
      Moves his tail like cedar, (cedar trees growing between 120 - 180 feet long!).
    </li>
    <li>
      Bones are like beams of bronze.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ribs like bars of iron.
    </li>
    <li>
      They were the <strong>first</strong> of God.
    </li>
    <li>
      So strong and massive that only God could take it down, (draw near His sword).
    </li>
    <li>
      It's so large that the Nile river <em>gushes</em> into it's mouth.
    </li>
    <li>
      The mountains yeild lots of food, and where it mingles with other creations (animals).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <hr>

  <em>
    <blockquote>
      Job 41: 1-2, 7-10 <br>
      Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue <br>
      with a cord which thou lettest down? <br>
      Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw <br>
      through with a thorn? <br>
      Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head <br>
      with fish spears? <br>
      Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. <br>
      Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast <br>
      down even at the sight of him? <br>
      None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able <br>
      to stand before me?



    </blockquote>
  </em>

  <h5>leviathan described</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This creature is so massive and tough that not even harpoons <br>
      can pierce its skin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any hope to overcoming it is without any success or results.
    </li>
    <li>
      People would be completely defeated by it (overwhelmed).
    </li>
    <li>
      Not a single person or thing is ferocious or aggressive enough to even <br>
      want to mess with it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Very powerful and libs are of even dimension.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is nothing on land like it's size and strength.
    </li>

  </ul>
<br>
<hr>
<p>These creatures described are extraordinarily massive!</p>
<p>We have massive animals in modern days like wales and elephants <br>
but the fact earlier men hunted wales and mammoths, doesn't describe the <br>
fact men wouldn't even think twice about messing with one.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Back in the early stages of creation. Man and beast were in harmony with <br>
eachother. There was no sin, there was no meaningless killing. </p>
<p>Once man sinned against God. That was the moment He knew the poison  <br>
of sin was already within us. And that it would be carried down from <br>
generation to generation. A never ending cycle of killing, wars, hatred, and death.</p>
