  <p>What is sin?</p>
  <p>Sin is a thought or action that we have as human beings. </p>
  <p>God did not create us with sin. We were created in <strong>his</strong> <br>
    image. Meaning, we were given from day one the knowledge of right from wrong. <br>
    With <em>free will</em> comes the ability to sin. Otherwise we would all be robots <br>
    (and obviously God did not want robot children). </p>



  <p>But..</p>
  <p>Because we did disobey him, He <strong>still</strong> wanted to <br>
    teach us the way to be able to enter his kingdom of Heaven.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>So sin is more-less doing the opposite of what our earthly parents do for us. <br>
    They make up rules, tell us what we shouldn't do, and they sit back to <br>
    see if we disobey their oders.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Same thing with God. He asks certain things of us and we should adhear to them. <br>
    But he strictly just wants us to believe him when he says that he came to <br>
    this earth to teach us his ways, and that he died on the cross trying to teach you his message.</p>
